\section{Revisions After Correction}
\label{sec:revisionsAfterCorrection}

Changes made after the correction by your supervisor must be highlighted in color. This is done with the command \verb|\rev{Modified Text}|. This will highlight the changes in the text in blue.

Example:\\
\rev{This text was added after the correction.}

Even small changes, such as replacing individual \rev{words}, must be highlighted in color.

If further rounds of correction are necessary, only the most recent changes should be highlighted. In the final version (before the final upload) of the work, all highlights must be removed.
